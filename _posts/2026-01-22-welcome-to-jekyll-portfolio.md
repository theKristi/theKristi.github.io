I'm excited to announce that I've just finished modernizing my portfolio website! After years of using the same Bootstrap 3 setup from 2014, it was time for a refresh.

## What Changed?

### Modern Technology Stack

I've migrated from a static Bootstrap 3 site to a Jekyll-based portfolio. Jekyll is perfect for a portfolio site because it:

- Works seamlessly with GitHub Pages
- Makes it easy to manage content with markdown
- Provides a clean templating system
- Allows me to focus on content instead of managing HTML

### New Site Structure

The site now has a cleaner organization:

- **Home**: A modern landing page showcasing featured projects
- **Projects**: Current and active projects I'm working on
- **Archive**: All my older projects, including Flash games and early experiments
- **Devlog**: This blog where I can share thoughts, ideas, and development notes

### Responsive Design

The new design is fully responsive and works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop. I've moved away from heavy frameworks to a custom CSS solution using modern features like CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Why Add a Devlog?

I've always wanted a place to document my development journey. The devlog will serve as:

1. **Project Ideas**: A place to brainstorm and explore new concepts
2. **Learning Notes**: Documentation of new things I'm learning
3. **Reflections**: Thoughts on development, challenges, and solutions
4. **Progress Updates**: Keeping track of what I'm working on

## What's Next?

I have several project ideas I'm excited to explore:

- Building a new web-based game using modern JavaScript
- Experimenting with Three.js for 3D graphics
- Creating interactive data visualizations
- Maybe even returning to game development with Unity

Stay tuned for more updates!

## Technical Details

For those interested, the site is built with:

- Jekyll (GitHub Pages compatible)
- Custom CSS with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Markdown for content
- No JavaScript frameworks (keeping it simple!)

All the old projects are still accessible in the Archive section, and all existing links remain functional.
