# Timer
I couldn't find a suitable Timer anywhere in javascript so I decided to make one.
##How it works
First you have to add Timer.js to your html. You can create your own css and make the Timers however you want. 
###Creating the timer
 You create a timer the same way you would create any object. You have to pass the interval into the constructor. 
 The interval is how often, in milliseconds, you want the timer to change, or any other functions to fire.  
 
   ``` javascript
    var timer=new Timer(10);
   ```
   in this example the timer will increment, and fire any other specified functions, every 10 milliseconds.
   
   Also, optionally, you can pass in a UNIQUE id you can use to identify one timer from another.
   ``` javascript
    var timer=new Timer(10, uniqueID);
   ```
There is a global timers[] array which we use to access the timer(s) when the window calls the setInterval function. When you pass in a unique id it sets that id as the index of that timer in the timers[] array
###Adding/Deleting Listeners
Timer.js has its own listener handling system. Each timer has its own listeners[] Array you can add or delete Functions from.
To add a listener to the timer you just have to call timer.addListener(function,[parameters]). For example,
``` javascript
    var timer=new Timer(10, uniqueID);
    timer.addListener(listener,["Hello!"]);
    /*now listener(array) will be called every 10 milliseconds
    and will print "Hello!" to the console*/
    function listener(parameters)
    {
      console.log(parameters[0])
    }
   ```

####Listener Functions
If you want a function that has parameters to be a listener you have to specify the parameters as an array in the function definition. This is because the function parameters are saved as an array.  
``` javascript
    function listener(parametersArray)
    {
      console.log(parametersArray[0]);
       console.log(parametersArray[1]);
    }
  ```
